 # Ultra-Marathon Statistical Comparison

## Overview
This project analyzes ultra-marathon running data, comparing the average speeds between male and female runners for 50km and 50mi races. The dataset contains over 7 million race records registered between 1798 and 2022. I have filtered the data to focus only on USA participants and the 50km and 50mi races. 

## Importance of Anaylsis
Ultra-marathon running is a sport that involves distances exceeding traditional marathons, and offers valuable insights into human endurance, performance, and gender differences in athletic achievement. With over 7 million race records spanning more than two centuries (1798-2022), this dataset provides the opportunity to analyze long-standing trends and the ability to compare the performance of male and female athletes. By examining data from a long period, it can be understood how ultra-marathon performance has evolved, identify patterns, and potentially uncover shifts in training, technology, or other factors that may have impacted the race times. By narrowing the analysis to participants from the USA and focusing on the most common race lengths (50km and 50mi), we can better understand performance trends within a specific population, making the findings more relevant for coaches, athletes, and organizers in the region.

Key findings from the analysis:
-** 50km Race**:
  - Female runners: Average Speed = 7.08 km/h
  - Male runners: Average Speed = 7.74 km/h
- **50mi Race**:
  - Female runners: Average Speed = 6.83 mi/h
  - Male runners: Average Speed = 7.25 mi/h
