Ultra-Marathon Statistical Comparison

 Overview
This project analyzes ultra-marathon running data, comparing the average speeds between male and female runners for 50km and 50mi races. The dataset contains over 7 million race records registered between 1798 and 2022. I have filtered the data to focus only on USA participants and the 50km and 50mi races. 

Key findings from the analysis:
- 50km Race:
  - Female runners: Average Speed = 7.08 km/h
  - Male runners: Average Speed = 7.74 km/h
- 50mi Race:
  - Female runners: Average Speed = 6.83 mi/h
  - Male runners: Average Speed = 7.25 mi/h

This project includes data cleaning, data manipulation, and graphical analysis of race performance based on gender and race length.

- Python: For data processing and analysis.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and querying.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: For creating visualizations.
- Jupyter Notebooks: For documenting the process and showcasing the analysis.
